        My name is Eden.

        I started taking photos in 2021. 
        It began as a form of self-expression - developing 
        later into a means of giving thanks.
        
        My identity as a trans woman developed independently 
        alongside my identity as a photographer. The queer people, 
        specifically the trans people in my life, helped shape 
        who I am now. Taking photos and showing the beautiful 
        souls that I see on my end of the camera is my way of 
        giving thanks to them for being the authentic people 
        that they are. I specialize in displaying my subjects 
        the way they want to be seen - mainly through portraits. 
        I prefer to shoot in every individual's natural environment: 
        be it their studio, their home, wherever they feel most comfortable. 
        Color and black and white options are available. 
        I shoot in 6x7 medium format. Sliding scale pricing.</p>
